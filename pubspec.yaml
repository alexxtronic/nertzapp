# Tech Stack Decision: Flutter
# 
# We chose Flutter for the following reasons:
# 1. Superior animation performance via Skia rendering engine - critical for 60fps card animations
# 2. Excellent gesture detection system for complex drag-and-drop interactions
# 3. True native performance without JS bridge overhead
# 4. Single codebase with consistent behavior across iOS and Android
# 5. State management options (Riverpod) excellent for complex realtime game state
# 6. Hot reload enables rapid iteration during game development
